# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Course
This is course I did to learn rest framework
***
***

## Prerequisites
- Python=>3.10

## Considerations
We will be calling our API throughout the next 8 modules. I have written the requests in (Curl)[https://curl.se/] and (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/]. 

(Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] provides a clean terminal output which is handy for this type of project. You will need to install it locally if you want to use the commands.
>Note: (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] is pre-installed in the docker container.

## Getting started
First you will need to clone down

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. I have called mine drf_course. This is your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone the first module. You can do this a few different ways. I use HTTPS

```
#option 1 - SSH
git clone --master basics git@github.com:vivekrajcvbnmkl/drf_course.git .

#option 2 - Github CLI
gh repo clone vivekrajcvbnmkl/drf_course .
git checkout master

#option 3 - HTTPS
git clone --branch master https://github.com/vivekrajcvbnmkl/drf_course.git .
```
